# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. You will be building an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. 

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built a webpage that displays a random meal based on which option the user chooses: side, main, dessert, or entire meal. The user can choose the category they prefer, click the "Let's Cook" button, and get meal inspirations to have for dinner. The entire meal option combines a randomly selected meal for side, main, and dessert.
### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
  1. Fork this repository.
  2. Clone your new, forked repo to your local machine.
  3. cd into the project's parent-level repository on your local machine.
  4. Open all files in your text editor.
  5. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal.
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
