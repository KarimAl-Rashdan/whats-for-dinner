# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built a webpage that displays a random meal based on which option the user chooses: side, main, dessert, or entire meal. The user can choose the category they prefer, click the "Let's Cook" button, and get meal inspirations to have for dinner. The entire meal option combines a randomly selected meal for side, main, and dessert.
